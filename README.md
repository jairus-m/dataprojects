# dataprojects
This is where I will host example code, practice projects, and data projects throughout my data learning journey. My goal is to not only share what I have learned, but also be able to see my personal progression. A little bit every day goes a very long way.

This repostitory includes a compilation of SQL queries and Python code used for data analysis.

In this GitHub repository, there are three branches: Main, Learning, and Scripts

1. The "main" branch is for data projects.

2. The "learning branch" is for practice code/projects.

3. The "scripts" branch is for scripts that I wrote to automate portions of data cleaning and formatting that I use for a volunteer position at a non-profit organization.
