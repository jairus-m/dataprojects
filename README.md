# dataprojects
A look into my data learning journey!

This repostitory includes a compilation of SQL queries and Python code used for data analysis.

In this GitHub repository, there are three branches: Main, Learning, and Scripts

1. The "main" branch is for data projects.

2. The "learning branch" is for practice code/projects.

3. The scripts" branch is for scripts that I wrote to automate portions of data cleaning and formatting that I used for a volunteer position at a non-profit organization.
